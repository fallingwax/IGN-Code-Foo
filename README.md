Contained with in this repository are the answers to the three of the four requirements for IGN Code Foo 8.  I chose to complete the back-end        requirement as my area of most confidence is in SQL and PHP. I completed the other responses in HTML and JAVASCRIPT.  


Discovered that I was missing the primary key on Thumbnails, foreign key constraints on GUID and need to alter the order that data is inserted to account for the foreign key being present before inserting into the thumbnails. I do not want to alter my original application but I wanted to account for those changes and improve on my work. I have created a separate branch for these changes. Will merge after completion of the IGN application process.
